        I worked on Apex's compiler. I led a big part of the QA effort for
        rewriting the compiler.

      <p>Notably I:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a Python script that used machine learning to correlate test
          failures across our suite of 35,000 compiler tests to find probable
          causes for compiler bugs
        </li>
        <li>
          Was part of a strike team that triaged performance issues that arose
          as we hit 1 billion API requests/month
        </li>
