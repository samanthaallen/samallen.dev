        I was one of the founding members on the LiveMessage Integration team,
        which was formed to integrate the acquisition of HeyWire. We rewrote
        LiveMessage, their instant messaging service.
      </p>
      <p>On this team, I:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Led a major portion of the rewrite of the acquisition's instant
          messaging product, which was previously in C++/Apex/VisualForce, into
          Java/JavaScript/Aura. The rewrite made it 100x faster (from 2 msg/sec
          to 200 msg/sec).
        </li>
        <li>Coordinated work across 5 teams</li>
        <li>
          Mentored engineers from the acquisition and trained them in Java best
          practices
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Java, JavaScript, Aura, PL/SQL
